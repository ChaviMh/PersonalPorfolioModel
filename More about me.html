    <p class="changes">Hey! I'm Chavi Moosanah, a passionate UI/UX designer based in Clavet Sebastopol, Mauritius. ðŸŒ´ðŸŒŠ<br><br> I love creating designs that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. <br> With a BSc (Hons) degree in Web and Multimedia Development, I have a solid foundation in both the technical and creative aspects of design. <br> I specialize in crafting intuitive user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional. 
        
        <br>I have experience working with industry-standard design tools like Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma, which help me bring my ideas to life. <br>
        
        <br>One of my strengths is my ability to truly understand user needs. <br> I conduct thorough user research to gain insights and create wireframes that lay the foundation for exceptional designs. <br> I also believe in the power of usability testing to ensure that my designs meet the needs and expectations of users. <br>
        
        Collaboration is key in my design process. <br><br>I thrive on working closely with cross-functional teams, developers, and stakeholders to create seamless user experiences. <br> My strong communication skills allow me to effectively communicate design decisions and iterate based on valuable feedback. <br>
        
        I'm excited about the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful designs that make a difference. <br></p>
